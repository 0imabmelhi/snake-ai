# How to Download BS EN 933 Standards for Geometrical Properties of Aggregates
 
BS EN 933 is a series of standards that specify methods for testing the geometrical properties of aggregates, such as particle size distribution, particle shape, flakiness index, shell content, surface characteristics, and fines content. These standards are important for ensuring the quality and performance of aggregates used in construction and civil engineering applications.

BS EN 933 standards are widely used in the construction and civil engineering industries to ensure the quality and performance of aggregates. Aggregates are granular materials that are used as fillers or binders in concrete, asphalt, mortar, plaster, and other construction materials. Aggregates can be natural or artificial, such as gravel, sand, crushed stone, recycled concrete, slag, or synthetic materials.
 
The geometrical properties of aggregates affect their behavior and interaction with other materials. For example, the particle size distribution of aggregates influences their workability, strength, durability, and permeability. The particle shape of aggregates affects their packing density, friction, and resistance to abrasion. The flakiness index of aggregates measures the proportion of flat or elongated particles that can reduce the stability and cohesion of mixtures. The shell content of aggregates indicates the amount of organic matter that can affect the chemical and biological properties of aggregates. The surface characteristics of aggregates determine their affinity for water and bitumen. The fines content of aggregates measures the amount of material passing a certain sieve size that can affect the cohesion and drainage of mixtures.
 
BS EN 933 standards provide methods for testing the geometrical properties of aggregates using various instruments and procedures. These methods are designed to ensure accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of results. BS EN 933 standards also specify the reporting and interpretation of test results, as well as the sampling and preparation of test specimens. BS EN 933 standards are harmonized with other European standards for aggregates, such as BS EN 12620 for aggregates for concrete, BS EN 13043 for aggregates for bituminous mixtures and surface treatments for roads, airfields and other trafficked areas, and BS EN 13242 for aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction.
